        	<p class="animated fadeInUpShort delay-250">Take the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oldcoloradoinn.com/">Old Colorado Inn</a> in downtown Stuart, for example. An unusual hotel, it’s composed of nearly half a dozen two-story historic bungalows that now act as guest houses. Every home is completely preserved down to the original Dade County pine floors, cedar beams, cozy attic nooks, and antique hardware. The proprietors here put me up in the Lyons House, which is the oldest house in Stuart and a Florida Literary Landmark. Named for longtime Stuart News editor Ernest Lyons, it gives literal meaning to the term “old school:” It was built in 1890 as the site of Stuart’s first schoolhouse. I immediately felt at home.</p>
            
            <p class="animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">The Old Colorado Inn is officially the most enchanting place I’ve ever stayed. Florida, like many places in the world, occasionally bulldozes the authentic and whimsical for the shiny and new—or worse, attempts to replicate true character. This is wonderfully the opposite. </p>
            
            <p class="animated fadeInUpShort delay-750">Downtown Stuart is super walkable, with delightful family-owned boutiques and restaurants—which makes it easy <a target="_blank" href="https://discovermartin.com/likealocal/">to live like a local</a>. Its free electric trolleys are also a fun transportation option and the best (and fastest!) way to get to Shepard Park on the St. Lucie River in time for a sunset sail on the historic <a target="_blank" href="https://www.treasurecoastsailingadventures.com/">Schooner Lily</a>. </p>
            
            <p class="animated fadeInUpShort delay-1000">Passengers on this magnificent, fully restored vessel—originally built in the early ’70s to haul cargo between Maine and Martha’s Vineyard—come prepared. Upon boarding, coolers filled with wine, snacks, and more wine were unzipped and cups were passed around, making the entire evening feel more like a casual sail with friends than a tourist activity. Which makes sense because most of the passengers weren’t actually tourists; they were primarily snowbirds soaking up the last days of crisp Florida temperatures.</p>

Jupiter Island is accessed via Bridge Road, which is completely covered in a breathtaking natural canopy courtesy of the banyan trees that line both sides.</p>

But the numbers only tell half the story.  The area’s stats are undeniably impressive: Almost 40 imperiled species depend on these 73 acres of protected land for survival. Upwards of 25,000 invasive plants have either been treated or removed to conserve the area. It’s the largest Anastasia limestone shoreline on the Atlantic Coast. </p>

Reed Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge</a> contains the largest contiguous section of undeveloped beach in southeastern Florida and is considered one of the most productive sea turtle nesting areas in the southeastern United States. The refuge is a sanctuary for nearly 40 species listed as either threatened, endangered, or of special concern. It is also an oasis for people who wish to experience what the early days of Florida must have been like. This biodiversity is supported by a large remnant of sand pine scrub, nearly 10 miles of mangrove communities along the Indian River Lagoon, and 3.5 miles of Atlantic Ocean beach. The beauty and uniqueness of Nathaniel P. Reed Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge inspires others to protect our wild places for future generations.</p>

			<p class="animated fadeInUpShort delay-500"><a href="https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/jonathan-dickinson-state-park" target="_blank">Jonathan Dickinson State Park</a> is the largest park in southeast Florida and was our second stop of the day. Its twisty Florida pines and winding, secluded paths can be explored on foot, bike, or even horseback, but one of the best ways to see it all is to hike the set of stairs that weaves through sand pine scrub to Hobe Mountain Tower, which at at 86 feet above sea level, is the “highest natural point south of Lake Okeechobee”. At the top, there’s a panoramic view of the Atlantic, Intracoastal Waterway, Jupiter Island, and of course the massive park itself.</p>

Founder of <a href="http://www.sunshinewildlifetours.com/" target="_blank">Sunshine Wildlife Tours</a>, she has more than two decades’ worth of experience on Indian River Lagoon, the most biodiverse estuary in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
 
			<p class="animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">We had barely launched her 35' pontoon boat “Sirenia” when she started reeling off facts about the area. One of her most notable lessons was that Martin County is one of the first counties in the state to issue a fertilizer ordinance. This means the magnificent waterfront homes, with equally magnificent lawns, are forbidden from using toxic herbicides like nitrogen or phosphorus during the months of May-September. This keeps runoff from polluting the lagoons and the 4,000+ species that live in them.</p>

			<p class="animated fadeInUpShort delay-750">“Without ecology, we have no economy,” Nancy explained.</p>

			<p class="animated fadeInUpShort delay-1000">We chugged along to Bird Island, which as the name aptly implies, is an island chock full of fifteen species of birds, including bright pink roseate spoonbills and American wood storks (the only stork native to North America). I watched pelicans feed their young in the treetops—quite a sight as it requires the baby pelicans to stick their entire heads inside their mothers’ mouth. As if on cue, Nancy said, “We’re born with same instincts as animals, but unlike animals, we spend our lives unlearning them.” </p>

This unique resort offers a wide array of activities from an 18-hole executive golf course, tennis, a mini spa, and a 77-slip marina. Situated on 200-acres, it’s bordered by the Atlantic Ocean beaches and Intracoastal Waterway.</p>

			<p class="animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">There, the coolest school bus that has ever graced the road arrived to take us out on a morning paddle. Salvaged from a junkyard, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theohanabus.com/">Ohana Bus</a> is plastered with bright colors, psychedelic stickers, and even a disco ball.</p>

			<p class="animated fadeInUpShort delay-750">Josh, one of Ohana Bus’s founders (and a former member of the U.S. Coast Guard) is everything you want in a paddleboard instructor: salty, barefoot, and adorned with tattoos and surfing scars. He immediately put me at ease, making me forget I hadn’t been on a paddleboard in years. We proceeded to SUP through mangroves and sandbars, and I am proud to report that I didn’t fall once. But there was plenty of that to come in the more adrenaline-filled activity of the day: conquering the EFoil with <a target="_blank" href="https://nlwatersports.com/">Next Level Watersports</a>.</p>

To get this thing flying, you steer the board using your body weight and adjust your speed with a wireless remote to control the throttle. For the non-experts, think of it as trying to rub your belly, pat your head—and do five other things—all at the same time.</p>

			<p class="animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">Back on dry land with my “board burned” legs that admittedly made me feel pretty tough, my photographer John and I stopped at <a href="http://www.ohanasurfshop.com/" target="_blank">Ohaha Surf Shop</a> owned by the Ohana Bus crew. I immediately felt like I had stepped into a movie scene. It was bustling with dogs and dreadlocked surfers sipping beers. The energy was intoxicating. I wanted to be part of it forever; this microcosm of Martin County.</p> 

			<p class="animated fadeInUpShort delay-750">It’s easy to get down and feel that beautiful places like Martin County are dwindling because of how we (humans, that is) are treating our planet. But this trip showed me that Florida is thriving not in spite of human involvement—it’s thriving because of it. Martin County proves that we can preserve the world by working together to let it be.</p>
